# Loan Qualifier Application

This is a python command line interface program that allows users to plug in various kinds of information to evaluate their loan eligibility. The application will match the user data against a list of bank loans from 'daily_rate_sheet' and return to the user a list of loans that they qualify for. Then, the user will have the ability to save that list, or to leave the application.
